I'm 20 years old and I'm a sophomore taking CS classes. For some reason I decided to change my course of life from being a full time athlete to a student-athlete majoring in CS on the other side of the world from my home. I have never taken any CS classes or code in any language before starting college, but I love math and solving any type of problems, and that's how I ended up in Computer Science.
